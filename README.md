# Obesity Prediction as a Service: Deploying a Real-Time AI Model with Flask and ngrok

This project provides an AI-based solution to predict obesity levels in real time. The model is deployed using Flask for a RESTful API and ngrok for public access, enabling external testing and integration.

## Features
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Provides instant results based on input data.
- **Flask API**: Hosts the prediction model as a RESTful API.
- **ngrok Integration**: Exposes the local API for public accessibility.
- **Lightweight Deployment**: Easy-to-use framework for rapid deployment.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obesity-prediction-service.git
   cd obesity-prediction-service
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Start ngrok to expose the app publicly:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

5. Use the provided ngrok URL to access the service.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `Flask`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `numpy`

## Usage
1. **Input Data**: Provide relevant features for obesity prediction.
2. **API Endpoint**: Send data to the API endpoint using tools like Postman or cURL.
3. **Receive Predictions**: Get the predicted obesity level as the output.

## File Structure
- `Obesity_Prediction_as_a_Service_Deploying_a_Real_Time_AI_Model_with_Flask_and_ngrok.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook explaining the implementation.
- `app.py`: Flask application script for deployment.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.

## Future Improvements
- Expand model to predict additional health metrics.
- Integrate user-friendly frontend for better interaction.
- Optimize model performance for faster predictions.
